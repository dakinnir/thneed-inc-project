## A GUI Web Application


The Thneed Inc project is a GUI program made for company's user to place orders on behalf of customers. This was a group project amongst fellow classmates. I was the lead programmer in charge of the graphical user interface aspect of the program. I was also the architect working out the classes and deciding what methods and data will each class need.
