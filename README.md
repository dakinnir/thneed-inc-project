# Overview


The Thneed Inc project is a GUI program made for a user to place orders on behalf of a customer. The program was designed with the concept of an employee being the primary user. The idea is that the employee would receive an order from a customer, and the employee would then come to this program to input the order information. Furthermore, the employee would be able to keep track of an inventory of thneeds. They will be able to add stock and stock will be removed when orders are placed in an automated way.
